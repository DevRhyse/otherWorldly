Final product will include React. Mutliple premade weather data will be prerendered. Entered Lat and Long will create new display. After number of created displays older displays will be removed. Caching system will be included and mars data will cached only on update.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned to implement OOP principles.
API bundling.
Tailwind implamentation.
Node
